## Introduction:<br>
This Deep Learning Web Application is build using Tensorflow-Keras in this we have used Transfer Learning in which we are using INCEPTION-V3 Architecture, this web application classify images of the diseased cotton leaf,fresh cotton leaf,diseased cotton plant and fresh cotton plant.During creating a perfect model we have trained this Cotton Leaf Image Dataset with Different Transfer Learning Architectures.

## Traininig and Validation Accuracy:<br>
